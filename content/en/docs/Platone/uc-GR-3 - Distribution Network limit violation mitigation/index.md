## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*

|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | The scope of the UC is to examine the operational use of flexibility tools in order to satisfy EN50160 in case of a voltage level limit violation in the distribution network and mitigate line congestion, especially in MV lines with flexible loads availability.  |
| **Objective(s)** | *To use network tariffs in order to incentivise a more efficient operation of the network while respecting operation limits (voltages, lines)  <br/>|
| **Related business case(s)** |add text|

***Notes:***
* **Scope** - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text.
* **Objective(s)** - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline.
* **Realted business case(s)** - optional

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**
Various types of flexible loads -aggregated for the scope of the Use Case- react to network tariffs sent by the DSO, so that a voltage/line thermal limit violation is mitigated.The DSO will examine the operation of tools and services for decision making support to mitigate voltage/thermal line limits violations, assuming that the grid state estimation has a good degree of certainty .

**Complete description**
Customers with flexible loads are connected to the distribution network and their loads are considered aggregated for the scope of the UCs regarding their management in the MV level. State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the state vector that the state estimation tool produces using the available measurements and the topology data from the AMR, GIS, SCADA and PMUs. The DSO communicates network tariffs in a day-ahead context. These tariffs appropriately reflect the potential of the network exceeding its physical limits resulting in violations and/or curtailment of demand/generation. Compared to the business as usual scenario of the flat network tariffs, the DSO aims at reducing such negative effects by the use of variable day-ahead network tariffs, which incentivise the appropriate actions of the -assumed as- rational users of the distribution network.

***Notes:***
* **Relation to other use cases** - relation to other use cases in the same project or thematic area. Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate.
* **Level of depth** - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used.
* **Prioritisation** - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand.
* **Generic, regional or national relation** - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur.
* **Nature of the use cases** - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like *technical, political, business/market, test*, etc.
